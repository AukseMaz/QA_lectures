## Performance Testing (Non-Functional)

1. Loading testing:

    Objectives of Load Testing  
        Measure system performance under normal and peak loads. 
        Identify performance bottlenecks (CPU, memory, database, network). 
        Ensure system reliability and stability before deployment. 
        Verify that response times and throughput meet performance requirements. 
        Optimize system architecture for scalability and efficiency.

2. Stress testing
    is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under extreme or beyond-normal load conditions. It helps determine the system’s breaking point and how it recovers after failure.

    Objectives of Stress Testing
        Identify the maximum capacity the system can handle before failure. 
        Analyze system behavior under extreme conditions (high traffic, low resources). 
        Determine the system’s breaking point and failure recovery ability. 
        Assess system stability when critical components (CPU, memory, network, database) are under excessive strain. Prevent crashes in production by identifying vulnerabilities.

3. Volume testing
    is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system handles large volumes of data. It focuses on database performance, data storage, and system response times when processing massive amounts of information.

4. Scalability testing
    is a type of performance testing that evaluates how well a system can scale up (vertical scaling) or out (horizontal scaling) in response to increasing workloads. It helps determine whether an application can efficiently handle growing user traffic, data volume, or transaction loads by adjusting resources.

5. Endurance testing
    also known as Soak Testing, is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system performs over a prolonged period under a sustained load. The goal is to detect issues like memory leaks, resource depletion, and performance degradation that might not be apparent in short-term tests.
